IQ is a molecular network-based chemical novelty index developed for prioritizing strains according to the probability of finding novel chemistry using molecular networks. IQ uses three key network metrics: Match Quality Scores (MQS) for annotated nodes, cosine values (COS) between annotated and unannotated nodes, and the proportion of unannotated nodes.
