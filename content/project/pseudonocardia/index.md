A research project that explores the specialised metabolism of *Pseudonocardia* strains from marine origin as a source of new antifungal metabolites with activity against *Candida* spp. The project is affiliated with the Institute of Pharmaceutical Research ([INIFAR](https://inifar.ucr.ac.cr/)). 

Project in collaboration with Dr [Katherine R. Duncan](https://www.medicinesfromthesea.com/) from the Biosciences Institute at Newcastle University.
