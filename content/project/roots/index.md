A research project that integrates (meta)genomics and metabolomics to explore the potential of actinomycetes isolated from the rice root endosphere as biological control agents to improve crop health. Project in collaboration with [Professor Max Chavarría](https://www.chavarrialab.com/) from CIPRONA/CENIBiot, [Professor Matt Hutchings](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/matt-hutchings/) from the John Innes Centre, and the [Bio Laboratory of Pelón de la Bajura](https://www.tiopelon.cr/productos/arroz/bio-arroz/).
