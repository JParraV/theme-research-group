abstract: The Natural Products Atlas is a database of microbially derived
  natural products that contains structures, producing organism taxonomy,
  biosynthetic and chemical ontology classifications, grouping by compound
  classes and cross-links to a suite of other natural product-related data
  resources. The database is supported by a web server that includes
  functionality to browse the collection, search the database using both
  chemical structures and text/numerical terms and visualize the chemical
  diversity it contains using interactive dashboards. In the current database
  release, we have curated 1347 papers, increasing the number of compounds to 36
  545. In addition, we have initiated a large-scale effort to incorporate data
  from papers reporting structural reassignments and revisions to previously
  published structures. This effort led to the incorporation of 590 corrections
  to existing entries, significantly improving the accuracy of the dataset. The
  Natural Products Atlas may be accessed at www.npatlas.org.
