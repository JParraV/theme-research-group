abstract: Within the natural products field there is an increasing emphasis on
  the study of compounds from microbial sources. This has been fuelled by
  interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both
  interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study
  of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the
  Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products
  structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the
  database which includes a full RESTful application programming interface
  (API), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128
  new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural
  and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all
  microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both NP Classifier
  and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries
  with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from
  external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have improved the user
  experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for
  taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new interactive website
  at https://www.npatlas.org.
