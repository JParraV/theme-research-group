abstract: Throughout the golden age of antibiotic discovery, Streptomyces have
  been unsurpassed for their ability to produce bioactive metabolites. Yet, this
  success has been hampered by rediscovery. As we enter a new stage of
  biodiscovery, omics data and existing scientific repositories can enable
  informed choices on the biodiversity that may yield novel antibiotics. Here,
  we focus on the chemical potential of rare actinomycetes, defined as bacteria
  within the order Actinomycetales, but not belonging to the genus Streptomyces.
  They are named as such due to their less-frequent isolation under standard
  laboratory practices, yet there is increasing evidence to suggest these
  biologically diverse genera harbour considerable biosynthetic and chemical
  diversity. In this review, we focus on examples of successful isolation and
  genera that have been the focus of more concentrated biodiscovery efforts, we
  survey the representation of rare actinomycete taxa, compared with
  Streptomyces, across natural product data repositories in addition to its
  biosynthetic potential. This is followed by an overview of clinically useful
  drugs produced by rare actinomycetes and considerations for future
  biodiscovery efforts. There is much to learn about these underexplored taxa,
  and mounting evidence suggests that they are a fruitful avenue for the
  discovery of novel antimicrobials.
