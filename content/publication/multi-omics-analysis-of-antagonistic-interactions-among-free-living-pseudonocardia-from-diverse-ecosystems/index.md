abstract: Actinomycetes are a phylogenetically diverse bacterial group which are
  widely distributed across terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Within this
  order, the genus Pseudonocardia and their specialised metabolites have been
  the focus of previous ecological studies due to their antagonistic
  interactions with other microorganisms and their mutualistic interactions with
  insects. However, the chemical ecology of free-living Pseudonocardia remains
  understudied. This study applies a multi-omics approach to investigate the
  chemical ecology of free-living actinomycetes from the genus Pseudonocardia.
  In a comparative genomics analysis, it was observed that the biosynthetic gene
  cluster family distribution was influenced mainly by phylogenetic distance
  rather than the geographic or ecological origin of strains. This finding was
  also observed in the mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiles of nine
  Pseudonocardia species isolated from marine sediments and two terrestrial
  species. Antagonist interactions between these 11 species were examined, and
  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation-mass spectrometry imaging was used
  to examine in situ chemical interactions between the Southern Ocean strains
  and their phylogenetically close relatives. Overall, it was demonstrated that
  phylogeny was the main predictor of antagonistic interactions among
  free-living Pseudonocardia. Moreover, two features at m/z 441.15 and m/z
  332.20 were identified as metabolites related to these interspecies
  interactions.
