  Pseudonocardia abyssalis sp. nov. and Pseudonocardia oceani sp. nov., two
  novel actinomycetes isolated from the deep Southern Ocean. International
  Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, 71(9), 005032.
abstract: The actinomycetes strains KRD168T and KRD185T were isolated from
  sediments collected from the deep Southern Ocean and, in this work, they are
  described as representing two novel species of the genus Pseudonocardia
  through a polyphasic approach. Despite sharing >99 % 16S rRNA gene sequence
  similarity with other members of the genus, comparative genomic analysis
  allowed species delimitation based on average nucleotide identity and digital
  DNA–DNA hybridization. The KRD168T genome is characterized by a size of 6.31
  Mbp and a G+C content of 73.44 mol%, while the KRD185T genome has a size of
  6.82 Mbp and a G+C content of 73.98 mol%. Both strains contain
  meso-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid, glucose as the major
  whole-cell sugar, MK-8(H4) as a major menaquinone and iso-branched
  hexadecanoic acid as a major fatty acid. Biochemical and fatty acid analyses
  also revealed differences between these strains and their phylogenetic
  neighbours, supporting their status as distinct species. The names
  Pseudonocardia abyssalis sp. nov. (type strain KRD168T=DSM 111918T=NCIMB
  15270T) and Pseudonocardia oceani (type strain KRD185T=DSM 111919T=NCIMB
  15269T) are proposed.
