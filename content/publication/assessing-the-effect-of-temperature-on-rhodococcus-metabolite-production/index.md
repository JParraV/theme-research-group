abstract: Rare actinomycetes are increasingly recognised as a valuable yet
  underexplored source of bioactive compounds with significant biomedical
  potential. While it is well established that bacteria have evolved adaptive
  mechanisms to withstand environmental stressors, such as variations in
  temperature, salinity or pH, our understanding of how these abiotic parameters
  influence bacterial metabolism remains limited. This has important
  implications not only for laboratory cultivation but also for predicting
  microbial behaviour in natural ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the
  effect of temperature on specialized metabolite production by the genus
  Rhodococcus. Seven strains isolated from marine sediments in three regions –
  Scotland, the sub-Arctic and Antarctica – were cultured at 20, 25 and 30 °C.
  Strain-specific growth curves were generated to normalize metabolite
  extraction at equivalent growth stages, resulting in a total of 54 Rhodococcus
  metabolite extracts. Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry
  analysis combined with molecular networking revealed that lower cultivation
  temperatures reduced bacterial biomass and delayed the onset of the stationary
  phase, and strain Rhodococcus KRD197 exhibited temperature shifts in
  metabolism that were associated with alterations in carbohydrate and fatty
  acid metabolism, potentially linked to osmotic regulation and cell membrane
  adaptation. These findings highlight the impact of temperature on
  Rhodococcus-specialized metabolism and support the potential of rare
  actinomycetes from extreme environments for expanding chemistry from these
  understudied genera.
