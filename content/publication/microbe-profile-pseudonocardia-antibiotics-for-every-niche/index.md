abstract: Pseudonocardia species comprise a genus of filamentous, sporulating
  bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinomycetota, formerly Actinobacteria. They
  are found in marine and freshwater sediments and soils and associated with
  marine animals, insects, and plants. To date, they have mostly been studied
  because of their mutually beneficial symbiosis with fungus-growing ants in the
  tribe Attini. They have also attracted interest due to their biosynthetic
  capabilities, including the production of variably glycosylated polyenes and
  other novel antifungal compounds, and for their capacity to grow on a variety
  of hydrocarbons. The majority of clinically used antibiotics are derived from
  the specialised metabolites of filamentous actinomycete bacteria and most of
  these come from the genus Streptomyces. However, in the quest for novel
  chemistry there is increasing interest in studying other filamentous
  actinomycete genera, including Pseudonocardia. Here we outline the biological
  properties, genome size and structure and key features of the genus
  Pseudonocardia, namely their specialised metabolites and ecological roles.
