abstract: "Last year ActinoBase, a Wiki-style initiative supported by the UK
  Microbiology Society, published a review highlighting the research of
  particular interest to the actinomycete community. Here, we present the second
  ActinoBase review showcasing selected reports published in 2020 and early
  2021, integrating perspectives in the actinomycete field. Actinomycetes are
  well-known for their unsurpassed ability to produce specialised metabolites,
  of which many are used as therapeutic agents with antibacterial, antifungal,
  or immunosuppressive activities. Much research is carried out to understand
  the purpose of these metabolites in the environment, either within communities
  or in host interactions. Moreover, many efforts have been placed in developing
  computational tools to handle big data, simplify experimental design, and find
  new biosynthetic gene cluster prioritisation strategies. Alongside, synthetic
  biology has provided advances in tools to elucidate the biosynthesis of these
  metabolites. Additionally, there are still mysteries to be uncovered in
  understanding the fundamentals of filamentous actinomycetes' developmental
  cycle and regulation of their metabolism. This review focuses on research
  using integrative methodologies and approaches to understand the bigger
  picture of actinomycete biology, covering four research areas: i) technology
  and methodology; ii) specialised metabolites; iii) development and regulation;
  and iv) ecology and host interactions."
