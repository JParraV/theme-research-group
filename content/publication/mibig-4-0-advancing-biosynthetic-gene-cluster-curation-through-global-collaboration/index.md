abstract: Specialized or secondary metabolites are small molecules of biological
  origin, often showing potent biological activities with applications in
  agriculture, engineering and medicine. Usually, the biosynthesis of these
  natural products is governed by sets of co-regulated and physically clustered
  genes known as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). To share information about
  BGCs in a standardized and machine-readable way, the Minimum Information about
  a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG) data standard and repository was initiated
  in 2015. Since its conception, MIBiG has been regularly updated to expand data
  coverage and remain up to date with innovations in natural product research.
  Here, we describe MIBiG version 4.0, an extensive update to the data
  repository and the underlying data standard. In a massive community annotation
  effort, 267 contributors performed 8304 edits, creating 557 new entries and
  modifying 590 existing entries, resulting in a new total of 3059 curated
  entries in MIBiG. Particular attention was paid to ensuring high data quality,
  with automated data validation using a newly developed custom submission
  portal prototype, paired with a novel peer-reviewing model. MIBiG 4.0 also
  takes steps towards a rolling release model and a broader involvement of the
  scientific community. MIBiG 4.0 is accessible online at
  https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/.
