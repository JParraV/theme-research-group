abstract: Multidrug-resistant pathogens have become a global threat. In this
  context, filamentous actinomycetes have been proven to be an exceptional
  source of antimicrobial metabolites. In particular, rare actinomycetes
  isolated from marine environments have been proposed as a potential source of
  yet untapped specialised metabolites. In this study, two novel species,
  Pseudonocardia abyssalis sp. nov. and Pseudonocardia oceani sp. nov., isolated
  from deep Southern Ocean sediments are described, both in terms of their
  phenotypic and genomic characterization. Furthermore, the genomic
  architecture, with a focus on Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGC), across eight
  strains belonging to the two novel species was investigated. As a result, a
  total of 13 Gene Cluster Families (GCF) were identified, of which six GCFs
  comprise BGCs from both species, and one was annotated specifically of each
  species. Following genome analysis, a comparative mass-spectrometry based
  metabolomics analysis was carried out, including phylogenetically
  closely-related non-marine species, as well as other Pseudonocardia strains
  isolated from different marine environments. Then, genomics and metabolomics
  data were correlated through NPLinker, an unsupervised method for integrating
  paired omics data. As a result, it was demonstrated that the BGC evolution and
  distribution across strains is mainly shaped by phylogeny over any
  biogeographical pattern.Furthermore, metabolomics and genome mining tools were
  used to assess the role of the specialised metabolites on interactions between
  members of the Pseudonocardia genus isolated from different marine
  environments. To this end, using challenge bioassays, antagonist interaction
  between nine Pseudonocardia spp. isolated from marine sediments and two
  non-marine species was examined and correlated to the strains' phylogeny and
  their metabolomics profile. To understand the spatial dynamics,
  matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry imaging
  (MSI) was used to examine in situ species chemical interactions between the
  Southern Ocean strains and their closest relatives. This analysis showed that
  phylogeny is the main predictor of antagonistic interactions among free-living
  Pseudonocardia strains. Moreover, a group of parent ions produced by P.
  abyssalis were identified as possible metabolites involved in the inter
  species interactions.Overall, this work showcases the power of a combined
  genomics-metabolomics approach to investigate rare actinomycetes from
  understudied locations and have uncovered a wealth of both biosynthetic and
  chemical diversity for further investigation.
