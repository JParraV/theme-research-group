abstract: "With an ever-increasing amount of (meta)genomic data being deposited
  in sequence databases, (meta)genome mining for natural product biosynthetic
  pathways occupies a critical role in the discovery of novel pharmaceutical
  drugs, crop protection agents and biomaterials. The genes that encode these
  pathways are often organised into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In 2015,
  we defined the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG):
  a standardised data format that describes the minimally required information
  to uniquely characterise a BGC. We simultaneously constructed an accompanying
  online database of BGCs, which has since been widely used by the community as
  a reference dataset for BGCs and was expanded to 2021 entries in 2019 (MIBiG
  2.0). Here, we describe MIBiG 3.0, a database update comprising large-scale
  validation and re-annotation of existing entries and 661 new entries.
  Particular attention was paid to the annotation of compound structures and
  biological activities, as well as protein domain selectivities. Together,
  these new features keep the database up-to-date, and will provide new
  opportunities for the scientific community to use its freely available data,
  e.g. for the training of new machine learning models to predict
  sequence-structure-function relationships for diverse natural products. MIBiG
  3.0 is accessible online at https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/."
