Raquel holds a Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Laboratory Science from the University of Costa Rica. Currently, she is conducting her dissertation focusing on the study of the chemical diversity of natural products derived from actinomycetes through untargeted metabolomics. Her research aims to explore the bioactive potential of the Pseudonocardia strains through the systematic variation of conditions that promote metabolite production (OSMAC).
